HACNet V2: Rethinking the Full-Resolution  Network for Pixel-level Crack Detection

Welcome to the official repository for HACNet V2, an advanced deep learning architecture designed for precise pixel-level crack detection. 

HACNetV2 is an enhanced full-resolution architecture that builds upon our previous HACNet. Through key architectural refinements and novel components, HACNetV2 achieves substantially improved efficiency and effectiveness compared to its predecessor. 

## üîç What distinguishes HACNetv2 from existing crack detection models?

### üöÄ Simplicity
HACNetv2 employs a straightforward architecture composed of six identical HybridASPA blocks, each maintaining consistent structure, parameters, input/output channel dimensions, and resolution. 

### üéØ Effectiveness
HACNetv2 demonstrates superior detection accuracy, particularly in identifying tiny and fine-grained cracks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models.

### ‚ö° Efficiency
With only **1.17M parameters**, HACNetv2 achieves real-time inference performance, making it highly suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as the **Jetson Orin AGX**.
