HACNet V2: Rethinking the Full-Resolution  Network for Pixel-level Crack Detection

Welcome to the official repository for HACNet V2, an advanced deep learning architecture designed for precise pixel-level crack detection. This repository will soon include the source code, enabling researchers and practitioners to replicate and build upon our work.

The source code for HACNet is available at [https://github.com/hanshenChen/HacNet](https://github.com/hanshenChen/HACNet).
